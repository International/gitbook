# Web Development with Iris

Go is a great technology stack for building scalable, web-based, back-end systems for web 
applications. 

When you think about building web applications and web APIs, or simply building HTTP servers in Go, your mind goes to the standard net/http package. Then you have to deal  some common situations like the dynamic routing (a.k.a parameterized), security and authentication, real-time communication and many others which we will analyze later. 
Obviously the net/http package is not enough to build well-designed web applications, here is where **Iris web framework** comes to play.
